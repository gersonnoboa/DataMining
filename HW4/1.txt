Visualization: provide visual representations of datasets intended to help people carry out some task more effectively
Human needs information of the dataset, not automated or hypothesis

data sets might be very different even though mean, etc is the same

many alternatives, not all work, experiments made to determine what works

types of data:
tabular -> categorical (non implicit order), ordered ordinal (S,M,L) + quantitative (17 inches, 23 inches)
relational ->
spatial ->

image theory
marks and visual channels

visual channel types, what/were (categorical), how much (ordinal, quantitative), grouping (relational, same category)

position is important

channel ranking: encode most important attributes with highest ranked channels

stevens psychophysical power law, color saturation is high, lenght is equal, brightness and area is low

separable channels separability, vs groups 

popout limits, one channel at a time

we don't see good in 3D, up down, sideways, occlusion, complexity, perspective distortion (interferes with size channel), text visibility,

color in 2d better, pixels are the scarcest resource

small multiple example: cerebral, encoding as color

global comparison is difficult in animation

validate against the right threat: problem (	misunderstood their needs), abstraction (showing wrong thing), encoding (the way you show it doesn't work), algorithm (code too slow)
